I sourced the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, and it pertains to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking firm. The fields include some information about the clients and how the marketers have engaged and reached out to the them to sell the products

The Goal of the Project:

The intent of this classification was to predict the probability that the customer will subscribe (1/0) to a term deposit investment product (variable y). The dataset I used can be found in the link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madmashup/targeted-marketing-predictive-engine/master/banking.csv

Tasks Completed: VIF, ROC, AUC, RFE, SMOTE, Confusion Matrix, Cross Validation
